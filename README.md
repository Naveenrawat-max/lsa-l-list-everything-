lsa ( List everything)
I have made this tool this is an alternative to the ls -l command on Linux this script loops through the directory you run this script will list all the flies and everything that your directory contains. it will be shown hierarchically. 
this tool will show content like this:- 

dir
   |__content
   |__subdir
     |__content
   

[-] To run this script just clone this repo to your Kali machine and check the permission if it is not executable give it the executable permission 
[-] and move it to the bin directory 
[-] then just simply type this `lsa` command and all done you will see the output
